              <h2>Why realtime graphics?</h2>
              <ul>
            
              <li>Interactive creativity - you can manipulate what will be your final image/animation while you work with it. When you know the software, this is very good for creativity which enables you to become a better artist.</li>
            
              <li>Sound responsiveness - you can design custom artistic worlds that react to sound and manipulate those in realtime to tweak the art to perfection, this is impossible when only programming or only using render-based 3d software, there you have the rendering time as a limiter and you can not "feel" what is happening</li>
            
              <li>Framerate - nothing beats 60Hz visuals. This ensures that your work is future proof, the japanese new TV standard is 200Hz for instance, and CRT monitors can produce smooth 100Hz animations, VSXu adapts to all these conditions (if the graphics card can deliver)</li>
            
              </ul>
