            <p>
                <i>VSXu has successfully been used at many live events including concerts and live band performances.</i><br>
                <br>
                Compared to most pre-rendered video, a real time source like VSXu provides much smoother movements and shorter reaction times.<br>
                <br>
                Running at 60 or 100 frames per second in or above Full HD resolution breaks no sweat from today's computers*. With VSXu you can relatively easy harness this power to your advantage.<br>
                <br>
                Done correctly, your audience will love the results!<br>
                <br>
                *Even the most bleeding edge movies run at only 48 frames per second. The difference in fluidity of motion is easy to spot.

            <h2>
                How can you implement it in your stage productions?
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Content created with <b>Artiste</b> can be run both in <b>Player</b> and on the <b>Server</b>. 
                The server is a stripped down player running fullscreen and you can connect to it over the network 
                from either <b>Artiste</b> or via standard TCP/IP using common scripting languaes PHP/Python/Perl. 
                The messages sent to control the engine are human readable and can even be typed in manually 
                - just telnet to the server.
            </p>
             
            <p>
                Thus you can have several computers paired with screens or projectors on/near the stage controlled via 
                standard PC networking equipment such as w-lan or Ethernet. <br>
                <br>
                Since the <b>Server</b> runs on GNU/Linux, you also save licensing
                costs amounting to about 25% per brand new computer. You can also use standard Gaming PC's if your 
                project is on a budget. (For help on how to design/build hardware suitable for VSXu - please contact us).<br>
